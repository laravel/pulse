| Pulse Dashboard
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Here you may configure the cards and layout of the Pulse dashboard.
|
| There are 12 columns available by default, but you may customize this by specifying the `cols` attribute on the `<x-pulse>` component as any number between between 1 and 12.
| You may also make the dashboard full width by setting the `fullWidth` attribute of the `x-pulse` to `true`.
|
| Most cards span 6 columns and 1 row on larger screens by default.
| You may customize this by specifying the `cols` attribute as a number between 1 and 12, and the `rows` attribute between 1 and 6.
|
| Most cards also allow setting an `expand` attribute to `true` to show all items, instead of scrolling.
